- Simple

- High performance

- From small website/web application to complex solution


### Why CMF comparing to typical CMS?
A typical CMS has a lot of features, but sometimes the extendability&quality is limited because of trying to have too many(especially in enterprise or when systems are complex). We believe the framework way is the best to keep minimal&open architecture(less is more :)), thus leave freedom to solution part or plugin libraries to have good quality.

### Why CMF comparing to pure web framework development approach?
Because anything related to content is handled by digimaker and things not related to content can be done via web framework and the CMF integrate with web framework well.

### What does the content mean here?
Content means most common information like articles, documents, users, products, images&videos etc, which need direct backend input and frontend display with permission control.

### Why call it progressive CMF?
It means with this framework, your solution can evolve from a small site/application to a complex solution, without hassal(keep good code quality, easy maintainability & extendability).

### Does it fit small website like many CMS?
It has more advantage in enterprise, especially scenarios where it evolves from small site/application to enterprise.
