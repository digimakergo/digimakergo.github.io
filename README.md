### Q&A
**Why CMF comparing to typical CMS?**

A typical CMS has a lot of features, but sometimes the flexiability is compomised(especially in enterprise or when systems are complex). We believe the framework way is better in some scenarios to keep minimal design&open architecture(less is more :)), thus leave freedom to the dever to maintain good flexiability & quality.

**Why CMF comparing to pure web framework development approach**

Because things related to content are handled by digimaker and those not related to content can be done via web framework and the CMF integrates with web framework well.

**What does the content mean here?**

Content means most common information like articles, documents, users, products, images&videos etc, which need direct backend input and frontend display with permission control.

**Why call it progressive CMF?**

It means with this framework, your solution/product can evolve from a small site/application to a complex solution, without hassal(keep good code quality, easy maintainability & extendability).
