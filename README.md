## Completely component based
It's completely component based, both in server side and client side, both in end user and in editorial ui.

It means you can control you app entry, also means the content management feature can be well intergrated into your existing system.

## Balanced content model design
Define your content model like object-oriented language's model, then it's can be used in backend, server api and rest api.

You can still use ORM or sql to easily access the content data.

## Beyond content
Typical content can be articles, documents, users, products, images&videos, also can be order, subcriptions, which is mix of content and database table. 

## Strong permission
Control your permission based on content types, under node, field value, etc. It supports attribute level permission, meaning some user can create/update limited fields of content.

Variable support meaning you can define permission rules and set values in role content directly using editorial ui.

## Log&Debug-able
You are able to see what's going on, from database query, to templates used, and permission policies. Good log&debug make development & maintaince smooth.
