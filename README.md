- Simple

- High performance

- From small website/web application to complex solution


### Why CMF comparing to typical CMS?
A typical CMS has a lot of features, but sometimes they are hard to extend(especially in enterprise or when systems are complex). We believe that non-content features are better be done via integrating with other system/framework/service, not included in products(CMS), while the content related features are better done via a framework way to have minimal&open architecture, thus give freedom&quality to solution part.

### Why CMF comparing to pure web framework development approach?
Because anything related to content is handled by digimaker and things not related to content can be done via web framework and the CMF integrate with web framework well.

### What does the content mean here?
Content means most common information like articles, documents, users, products, images&videos etc, which need direct backend input and frontend display with permission control.

### Why call it progressive CMF?
It means with this framework, your solution can evolve from a small site/application to a complex solution, without hassal(keep good code quality, easy maintainability & extendability).

### Does it fit small website like many CMS?
It has more advantage in enterprise, especially scenarios where it evolves from small site/application to enterprise.
