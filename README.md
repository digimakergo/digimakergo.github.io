- Simple

- High performance

- From simple website to complex solution


### Why CMF comparing to typical CMS?
A typical CMS has a lot of features, but sometimes they are hard to extend(especially in enterprise or when systems are complex). We belive that non-content features(eg. e-commerce) should be done by services, not in products(CMS), while the content related features should be in a framework way to have minimal&open architecture, thus give freedom&quality to solution part.

### Why CMF comparing to pure web framework development approach?
Because anything related to content is handled by digimaker and things not related to content can be done via web framework and the CMF integrate with web framework well.

### What does the content mean here?
Content means most common information like article, document, user, product, images&videos etc, which need direct backend input and frontend display.

### Why call it progressive CMF?
It means with this framework, your solution can evolve from a small site/application to a complex solution, without hassal(keep good code quality, easy maintainability & extendability).

### Does it fit small website like many CMS?
It has more advantage in enterprise, especially scenarios where it evolves from small site/application to enterprise.
